Just follow the name of the filename by a space and the letters bmp. For example, msdraw &#151;i script &#151;r output.bmp bmp</P><B><FONT FACE="Helvetica" SIZE=4><P>Endian Issues</P></B></FONT><P>The msdraw program will now write SGI and SUN Raster image files in big endian format, regardless of the platform that the msdraw program is compiled on. Conversely, the msdraw program will now write BMP image files in little endian format, regardless of the platform that the msdraw program is compiled on. The binary surface files are written in an endian format that is dependent on the platform that msroll is compiled on, so binary files written by msroll on a big endian machine must still be read by an msdraw compiled on a big endian machine, and similarly for little endian machines. </P><B><FONT FACE="Helvetica" SIZE=4><P>Executable Files</P></B></FONT><P>The software now includes not just source files, but also executable files for the following platforms: SUN Microsystems SPARC, SGI MIPS, Apple Power Mac and Wintel. The Wintel executables require the cygwin1.dll, which can be downloaded for free from http://www.dll-files.com/ </P><B><FONT FACE="Helvetica" SIZE=4><P>Example Scripts</P></B></FONT><P>In the scripts subdirectory, you will find shell scripts and msdraw scripts for creating most of the images found in the manual. Scripts ending in "sel" are for selecting which atoms in the PDB file to include in the molecule. The scripts in this directory may differ in minor ways from the examples in the manual; for example, the paths to the pdb and bin directories may vary. </P><B><FONT FACE="Helvetica" SIZE=4><P>Compressed Files</P></B></FONT><P>There is now a directory structure to the files that are included. The executables are in subdirectories sun, sgi, mac, win. The documentation is in doc. The source code is in src. The pdb files are in pdb. The scripts are in scripts. The compressed files are in msp.tar.Z for UNIX (SUN and SGI), ZIP for Windows, and StuffIt for Macintosh. </P></BODY></HTML>
