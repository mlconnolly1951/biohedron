Molecular Surface Package Version 3.9.3 - March 2006
The tar file has been compressed by the UNIX compress command.
Type uncompress msp.tar.Z to convert it to msp.tar.
Use tar -xvf msp.tar to extract everything from the .tar archive.
Use WinZip to extract from the .zip archive.
Use StuffIt to extract from the .sit archive.
You will need to create the bin subdirectory yourself.
If you do not have a C compiler, copy the 4 executable files
from the appropriate directory (mac, win, sgi or sun) to the bin directory.
If you do have a C compiler, cd to the src subdirectory
and type "make all" from a command prompt.
The Windows/Intel executables were created in the Cygwin environment
and need at least the cygwin1.dll to run. 
The Mac executables need Mac OS X.
